# Bootstrap Multiplier
This is a linear DOM structure multiplier, ideally for multiplying a group of form elements which are need to be cloned

## Working demo
As this JS component is very light-weight I don't want to add more than a simple demo, you can find the sources and try it in work on Bootply: http://www.bootply.com/XVeorQoaKs
